# Omakub-MJ

Turn a fresh Manjaro GNOME installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub-MJ. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub-MJ is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

This is a FORK of the original [Basecamp's Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/). The original project targets only Ubuntu. This fork is intended for Arch Linux in general - Manjaro Gnome, in particular.
