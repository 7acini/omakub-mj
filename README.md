# Omakub-MJ

Turn a fresh Manjaro GNOME installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub-MJ. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub-MJ is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

Watch the introduction video and read more at [omakub.org](https://omakub.org).

This is a FORK of the original [Basecamp's Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/). The original project targets only Ubuntu. This fork is intended for Arch Linux in general - Manjaro Gnome, in particular.

There is an Arch version for WSL2 on Windows, called [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL). There are at least 2 things to keep in mind:

1. it uses fakeroot-tcp instead of fakeroot. lazydocker script takes care of this dependency
2. docker must be installed externally through [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) after setting up ArchWSL. It should create the proper docker client cli commands inside Arch. Run Omakub-MJ after that.

## Install

From a Terminal run:

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/omakub-mj/master/boot.sh | bash

And follow the instructions on screen.
